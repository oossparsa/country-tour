# country-tour
This an implementation of an evolutionary algorithm to both maximize and minimize the length of a route going twice through a given set of N points (cities) in 2-dimensions.

The parameters P(population size) and U(number of parents to be selected) are set by the user at runtime, the N points X = (x1;x2) are
read in from the text file Positions_(cities).txt.
The program outputs the fitness of the best individual, the mean fitness and the least fitness of the parents in every generation 
The development of these three values are depicted into a graph (the PNG files)
